        <h1>About me!
        </h1>
        <p>Hello! I am Praful Sigdel. I am a rising Junior pursuing 3+2 bachelors
          degree in Physics at Fisk University and Mechanical Engineering at 
          Vanderbilt. I am originally from Kathmandu, Nepal. Thanks to Wright 
          brothers and successor flight scientists who made modern aviation 
          accessible by which I was able to fly about 8000 miles around the 
          globe to the United States. Currently, I live in Nashville, city of 
          country music.
        </p>  
        <p>I love playing musical instruments. I played
          <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rk0vVpqvtMI" target="_blank">drums
          </a> when I was in high school. I taught myself how to play guitar
          and I am learning to play the piano at the moment. I find music relaxing.

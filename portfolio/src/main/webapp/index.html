        <h1>My Portfolio</h1>
        <p>Namaste! Welcome to my portfolio. Let's think of human existence 
          for some seconds. Where are we? How are we here? Have we been able to 
          understand the reason behind our existence? Let's think through this.
          In the ever increasing universe, our location is in a tiny 
              galaxy known as Milky Way. The radius of the Milky Way galaxy is 52,850 light years. 
              (Remember! light years is a unit of distance not time. 
              1 light year = 9.461*10^12 km or 5.87*10^12 miles) Now you may wonder
              why I called it a tiny galaxy. The distance between earth and the 
              observable edge of the universe is 46 billion light years making the 
              diameter around 93 Jeff's net worth is 93 billion dollars(Might reach 
              this number in the future). If we take the fraction of money equivalent
              to the size of milky way galaxy then it would be around 0.00011365 
              percent of his net worth.
          </p>
          <p>See! How tiny is it? Now, let me co me back to my initial argument. 
              If milky way is such tiny then you can imagine the 
              relative size of the solar system in comparison to the universe, the 
              size of the earth to the solar system, and your size to the earth. 
              Does it sound fascinating? May be or maybe not? I might have 
              helped you a little bit in understanding your present existence 
              and location. Other questions that I raised above are 
              "Life's Big Questions" and humans since the beginning of evolution 
              have been trying to answer. In this grand scale, do we really exist?ðŸ¤”ðŸ¤”
          </p>
          <p>Now, let's set this argument aside (I promise, we will come back 
              to it again soon.), and jump into the story of a human 
              being who is living in a lakehouse that abuts the old Tennessee lake. 
              Currently, this tiny cognitively sensible living being is in front
              of his laptop trying to understand how to write a Javascript function 
              as a part of his internship.
          </p>
          <p>Wait, I forget to introduce myself. Try any one of them and I will
              open up to you!
